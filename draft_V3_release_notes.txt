Pest++ version 3.0 release notes

Pest++ has undergone substainial improvments and enhanced for the version 3.0 release. \\

Major enhancements:

1.) regularization mode that support dynamic regularization weight adjustment 
2.) restart capabilities, during both base and super parameter iterations
3.) c++ implementation of model interface (instruction and templates)
4.) first super parameter jacobian calculated from base sensitivities
5.) threaded YAMR slaves for easier detection of failed runs and load balancing
6.) support for both J^TQJ and Q^(0.5)J in SVD factorization
7.) support for propack iterative SVD factorization

Minor tweaks:

1.) more verbose .rec and .rmr file
2.) creation of an iobj,isen,ipar csv file that summarized the iteration-specific objection function components, sensitivities, and parameters, resepctively
3.) case insensitivity for parameters and observations
4.) maintaining order of parameters and observations in output
5.) checking of template and instruction files at start of run
6.) writing sensitivity files


In addition, the code base has undergone a lot of refactoring and cleanup.
