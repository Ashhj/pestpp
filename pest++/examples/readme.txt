This file contains a brief description of the example problems
included in subdirectories contained herein.

1) stor - This directory contains the files needed to reproduce the
     simple storage example problem published in Appendix 6 of "PEST++,
     a Parameter ESTimation code optimized for large environmental
     models. U.S. Geological Survey Techniques and Methods, book 7,
     section C5".   
     
2) stor_genie - This directory contains files which run a simple
     storage problem using PEST++ in parallel mode using the GENIE 
     parallel run manager.  This is the same example problem whose
     serial solution was published in Appendix 6 of "PEST++, a
     Parameter ESTimation code optimized for large environmental models.
     U.S. Geological Survey Techniques and Methods, book 7, section C5".
