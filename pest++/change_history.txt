Change History

PEST++software version 2.2.0 as of March 31, 2014:

Changes made from version 2.2.1 to 2.2.2
	1) Added performance output file(.pfm) to track execution time
	2) Added input option MAX_RUN_FAIL
	3) Added input option SUPER_RELPAMAX
	

Changes made from version 2.2.0 to 2.2.1
   	1) Refactored parameter freezing algorithm to be more consistent with that of PEST
   	2) Imlimented JtQJ solution with Scaling - this is now the default as it is more tolerant of noise
   	3) Impilmented chain rule to transform differentials

Changes made from version 1.1.2 to 2.2.0
        1) Added supprt for .rei, bpa, .sen and .svd output files
        2) Switched from Rotation Factor to Marquardt Lambda
        3) Optimized code for large problems
           - spped optimizations
           - matricies now stored using Eigne's sparce storage format
        4) Replaced LAPACK++ with Eigen
        5) Added YAMR run mamanger
        6) Added Linux makefiles
        7) Added support for /j command line option for reusing an existing jacobian file
        

Changes made from version 1.1.3 to 1.1.4
	1) Save parameters when NOPTMAX = 0
	2) Added output to *.sen, *.par# and *.rei files


Changes made from version 1.1.2 to 1.1.3
	1) Report version number when no control file is entered on the command line
	2) Starts when .pst extension is included on the command line
	3) Enhanced super parameter formulation - super parameters changed to represent changes in parameters

Changes made from version 1.1.1 to 1.1.2
	1) Added support for NOPTMAX = 0
	
Changes made from version 1.1.0 to 1.1.1
	1) Fixed bug in processing instruction files
	
Changes made from version 1.0.1 to 1.1.0
	1) Fixed bug in calculating sensitivities of reularization information
	2) Fixed bug in calculating upgrade vector
	3) Refactored code to facilitate future work in global sensitivity analysis
        4) Removed dependency on libiomp5md.dll

Changes made from version 1.0.0 to 1.0.1:
	1) Changes to PROPACK implementation
	2) Changes to auto normalization implementation
	3) Reporting of SVD solver in output
